TODO
====

* Add ability to "Star" bugs

* Fancy select-ui2 thing for products and components

* Ability to post comments

* Upon selecting a bug and it doing a fetch, add `groups` to the
  include_fields and use that to deduce if the bug is private
  (dkl suggests: " if you do include_fields=groups, you just look at
  whether the list for that key has 1 or more entries")

* Support ngAnimate
