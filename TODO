TODO
====

* New bugs don't seem to get updated with comments

* Add ability to "Star" bugs

* Ability to post comments

* Support ngAnimate
  http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_12

* Being able to add bugs outside chosen products as "misc" bugs
  This might need an interface, like "Find bugs you've reported"

* Keyboard shortcuts for listing up and down


SOME DAY TODO
=============

* Refactor so that `bug.things` doesn't get stored when saving a bug

* Retroactively, for all attachments that are image/* content types,
  download them separately and use http://stackoverflow.com/a/3223466
  to resize them into thumbnails.

* Upgrade localForage and use promises

DONE
====

* Loading indicators

* Replace "From Tilo Mitra at 3:56pm, April 3, 2012" line on selected
  bug

* Permlink all dates on comments

* Fix orderBy

* Header on list to refresh

* Nav color coded statuses

* First fetch by bugs you're CC'ed on or assigned to

* Cache /configuration API (cache the 'all' variable)

* When downloading comments on a bug, it needs to reset the `extract`

* Auth!

* Cache the gravatar calculation because it's slow

* Combine history with comments

* interval that repeatedly fetches new bugs

* Use mcote's notes re native REST API and products

* Seems `things` doesn't get the right sort order

* interval that repeatedly fetches updated bugs

* Submitting search when there's only one bug found should select that
  bug

* Filtering by "Assigned to me" AND Status=NEW should only match bugs
  that are assigned to me AND Status=NEW

* Refactor to use "sub-controllers"

* Offline indicator

* Delay on the search using $scope.$watch
  http://stackoverflow.com/a/15304977

* About page

* Map emails -> names for comments (find out from Dave Lawrence)

* Ability to filter by product

* Upon selecting a bug and it doing a fetch, add `groups` to the
  include_fields and use that to deduce if the bug is private
  (dkl suggests: " if you do include_fields=groups, you just look at
  whether the list for that key has 1 or more entries")

* Loading dialog

* Upgrade to latest angularjs

* Filter by changed bugs (like you can with unread)

* Display attachments
