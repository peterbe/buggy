SOME DAY TODO
=============

* Figure out why comments don't have the real name but bugs do

* Map emails -> names for comments (find out from Dave Lawrence)


DONE
====

* Loading indicators

* Replace "From Tilo Mitra at 3:56pm, April 3, 2012" line on selected
  bug

* Permlink all dates on comments

* Fix orderBy

* Header on list to refresh

* Nav color coded statuses

* First fetch by bugs you're CC'ed on or assigned to

* Cache /configuration API (cache the 'all' variable)

* When downloading comments on a bug, it needs to reset the `extract`

* Auth!

* Cache the gravatar calculation because it's slow

* Combine history with comments

* interval that repeatedly fetches new bugs

* Use mcote's notes re native REST API and products

* Seems `things` doesn't get the right sort order

* interval that repeatedly fetches updated bugs

* Submitting search when there's only one bug found should select that
  bug

* Filtering by "Assigned to me" AND Status=NEW should only match bugs
  that are assigned to me AND Status=NEW

* Refactor to use "sub-controllers"

* Offline indicator

* Delay on the search using $scope.$watch
