# buggy

A client-side wrapper on the bugzilla.mozilla.org REST API.


### Distribution

To run this you can simply open `./client/index.html`. But for
production, you can run `python ./make.py` and it will generate all
the files optimized inside a directory called `./dist`.

See `python make.py --help` for more options.
